## PDF IMPORTER  
This plugin is made with the intention of giving designers the freedom to import PDFs to their design space as an image and then work with it from there. Often times a designer has to go to a converting website and get the PDF converted to a format suitable to him and then import it to his Figma account. This plugin aims to avoid that by a single click of choosing the PDF.
